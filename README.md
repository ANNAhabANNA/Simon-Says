## About The Project

The project idea was inspired by childhood memory game Simon Says. Simon was released by Milton-Bradley in 1978 with much fanfare, including a midnight release party at Studio 54, the elite disco in New York City. An instance success, the game reached its peak during the 1980s and continued to sell for decades thereafter.[http://web.pdx.edu/~kherb2/project2-simon-game/#:~:text=Simon%20was%20released%20by%20Milton,to%20sell%20for%20decades%20thereafter.](https://example.com)

The aim of the game is to repeat a series of random computer clicks. After each round, the sequence becomes longer by one click which makes it harder to remember. 

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
